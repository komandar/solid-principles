Single Responsibility Principle
===============================

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### Principles
* A class should only be responsible for one thing.
* There's a place for everything and everything is in it's place.
* Find one reason to chage and take everything else out of the class.
* Very precise names for many small classes > generic names for large classes.
