Open/Closed Principle
=====================

An entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Principles
* An entity should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Extend functionality by adding new code instead of changing existing code.
* Separate the behaviors, so the system can easily be extended, but never broken.
* **Goal: get to a point where you can never break the core of your system.**
