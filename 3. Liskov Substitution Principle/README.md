Liskov Substitution Principle
=============================

xyz

### Principles
* Any derived class should by  able to substitute it's parent class without the consumer knowing it.
* Every class that implements an interface must be able to substitute any reference throughout the code that implements that same interface.
* Every part of the code should get the expected result no matter what instance of a class you send to it, given it implements the same interface.
