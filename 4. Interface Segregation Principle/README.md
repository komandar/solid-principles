Interface Segregation Principle
===============================

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

### Principles
* A client should never be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use.
* Or, a client should never depend on anything more than the method it's calling.
* Changing one method in a class shouldn't affect classes that don't depend on it.
* Replace fat interfaces with many small, specific interfaces.
