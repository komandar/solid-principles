Dependency Inversion Principle
==============================

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### Principles
* Never depend on anything concrete, only depend on abstractions.
* High level modules should not depend on low level modules. They should depend on abstractions.
* Able to change an implementation easily without altering the high level code.
